            <h2>Personal Website</h2>
          <p>This project is a personal project to help organize my personal portfolio.
            I used this project to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. 
            I had fun learning these languages but also that troubles along the way.
            The most difficult part was managing my time so I can balance my University courses while I attempt to learn how to do web developing.
            The website is incomplete and will be updated accordingly.

          <p>This project is for the course ENSF 409 - Principles of Software Development. 
            This project simulates a course registration system for a school. 
            It uses Java as the main system and MySQL for the simulated database system.
            The program prompts the user to view, search, and register into courses of their choice.
            Little bit of MySQL is used to store the different courses that are offered in the school.

          <p>
            This project is for the course ENSF 480 - Principles of Software Design.
            This project simulates a movie theatre seat reservation system.
            It uses Java as the main system and uses a text based database. 
            The program allows user to pick a certain movie, and choose the available showtime.
            The user then picks an available seat and confirms the checkout for payment.
